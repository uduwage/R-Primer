# R-Primer

Goal of this tutorial is to provide a good coverage in R language. How do we determine good? I thought it would be helpful if we start from basic operations, data types and then move on to core statistics in a practical format using R as the language.

### Where to start from?
As we move forward there will be changes to structure of files but for now Start with Following order:

- RBasic.R
- RDataTypes.R
- RVector.R

Each of these scripts have documentation explaining each line of the code. 

You don't have to have a github account to view any of these. But if you have go ahead and fork / clone the repo. But if you are learning R for the first time, I would highly encourage you to type these things instead of copy pasting on the terminal / RStudio.
